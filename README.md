# Hello, I’m Tausia Tahsin Nuzum 👋

I am a **Computer Science and Engineering graduate** from **Independent University, Bangladesh**  
(**CGPA: 3.94 / 4.00**), with a strong interest in **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**,  
**User-Centered Design (UCD)**, and **applied AI systems** that support real-world human needs.

## About Me

### Research-Oriented Developer (HCI & AI)

- Focused on the intersection of **HCI, AI, and user-centered system design**
- Experienced in **designing, building, and evaluating interactive systems**
- Strong emphasis on **usability testing, iterative design, and evidence-based evaluation**

---

## Final Year Thesis Project: **FocusAI**

**FocusAI** is an AI-integrated focus and productivity application designed to help university students mitigate academic procrastination.

- Designed using **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles  
- Informed by a **needfinding survey** with university students  
- Implemented as a functional prototype using **Flutter** and **Firebase**  
- Integrated a **LLM-based relational agent** for personalized, task-aware motivation  
- Conducted **iterative usability evaluation** using the **System Usability Scale (SUS)** across two study rounds  
- Collected and analyzed both **quantitative (SUS, APS)** and **qualitative** user feedback  

This project strengthened my interest in **human–AI interaction**, **conversational agents**, and **usability-driven system design**.
